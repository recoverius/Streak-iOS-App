Streak is an experimental minimalist habit tracking app developed in just 6 hours with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project showcases the potential of AI-assisted rapid prototyping in iOS app development.

## Development Process

This app was created as an experiment in rapid prototyping using AI assistance (Sonnet 3.5 and 10 preview). The entire development process, from ideation to implementation, was completed in 6 hours with the help of Large Language Models. Key steps in the process:

- Initial app concept and feature brainstorming with LLM
- Architecture and code structure planning
- Iterative development of key features
- Basic UI/UX design implementation
- Core functionality testing

## Limitations and Future Work

Due to the time constraint, some features may be implemented in a basic form. Future improvements could include:

- Enhanced data visualization
- More robust achievement system
- Additional customization options
- Comprehensive testing suite
